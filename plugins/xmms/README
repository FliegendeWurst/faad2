1 -- Introduction.
2 -- Warning
3 -- How to build the plugin

Hey, nice to see that i could realise a plugin for xmms .. :), so what about
this plugin. This is a plugin to play AAC files (.aac) encoded with FAAC or
the windows program psytel aacenc.exe

The plugin read aac files with and without ID3tag(version 2.x), AAC files
are MPEG2 or MPEG4 files that could be found in MPEG4 audio files (.mp4).
MPEG4 files with aac inside could be reads by RealPlayer or Quicktime.

For any informations about this plugin contact me at :

			!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!
if at the end of some song there is a segfault (xmms going out!),
this is probably you have an old aac song encoded with an old psytel
encoder (maybe a 1.x).
To avoide this error use psystrip.exe windows program on the file. This maybe
resolve this problem.

this plugin was tested with the psytel encoder 2.15 (MPEG4 version for all
profile)

tested on a linux LFS 3.3 with :
Glibc-2.2.5
gcc-2.95.3
gtk+-1.2.10
glib-1.2.10
xmms-1.2.7
id3lib-3.8.0
wine
faad2 1.1

I don't test it for more than 2 channels file, i don't have such files...
if you wana test and give feedback could be great :)

HOWTO Build the plugin.
-----------------------

check that xmms-config could be run from a terminal.

before, you should take the faad2 1.1 package from
www.audiocoding.com
go into the faad2 directory with a user account :
install the libsnd you found into the common/libsnd directoy
then run in the faad2 top directory :

	- sh bootstrap
	- ./configure
	- make (this build libfaad and libmp4v2)
	- make install (with the root account)

then now you should run a ldconfig or add a line
into your /etc/ld.so.conf (and run a ldconfig again)


so now you have the libfaad installed you could
install the id3lib, with the common configure && make && make install.
take the library from the net not from the common/id3lib directory

so now you have libffad and libid3 you could build the xmms plugin
run these command to build the xmms-acc plugin :

	- sh bootstrap
	- ./configure ID3_LIB=<path to the id3lib install>
		FAAD2_DIR=<path to the faad2 install>
	- make

then you should find the libaac.so file into the src directory.
copy this file into your ${HOME}/.xmms/Plugin/ or in the
common plugin directory of xmms...


NB: sorry i not a pro of automake or autoconf i prefere to build a Makefile
that a user could change to adapte to his computer. You should find the
original Makefile into the src directory. his name is Makefile.save :)
