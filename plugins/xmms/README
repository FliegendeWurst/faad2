				-------------

Hey, nice to see that i could realise a plugin for xmms .. :), so what about
this plugin. This is a plugin to play AAC files (.aac) encoded with FAAC or
the M$ windows program psytel aacenc.exe

The plugin read aac files with and without ID3tag(version 2.x), AAC files
are MPEG2 or MPEG4 files that could be found in MPEG4 audio files (.mp4).
MPEG4 files with aac inside could be read by RealPlayer or Quicktime and with
my mp4 audio only xmms plugin. Also you could check the lamip project on
sourceforge.

For any informations about this plugin contact me at :

			!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!
if at the end of some song there is a segfault (xmms going out!),
this is probably you have an old aac song encoded with an old psytel
encoder (maybe a 1.x).
This error is comming from faad2
To remove this error use psystrip.exe windows program on the file. This maybe
resolve this problem.

this plugin was tested with the psytel encoder 2.15 (MPEG4 version for all
profile)

I don't test it for more than 2 channels file, i don't have such files...
if you wana test and give feedback could be great :)

Also note that if you have old aac files encoded with psytel 2.15 you should
use the 0.4 version of this plugin. (see my home page). This version
handle the new AAC files with new ADTS header size.
	-------------------------------------------------------------

To build this plugin just run and install the faad2 package
also check that you have :
id3lib-3.8.x (http://www.id3.org), the lastiest version is better
xmms-1.2.7 (http://www.xmms.org)
