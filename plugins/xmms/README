Dependencies

aac-XMMS uses FAAD as the AAC audio decoder, and id3lib for ID3v2 tag 
functionality.

FAAD:	www.audiocoding.com
	Use the CVS branch.  If using the january 26 release, at least
	apply the patch from the forum (01-26-02 22:31), it'll fix the
	crashes at the end of some AAC files.

id3lib:	id3lib.sourceforge.net
	Version 3.8.0pre2.  No modifications necessary.

Building
========

Modify the supplied Makefile to match your build environment.  You may have
to update the include directories.

./make

Copy libaac-XMMS.so to ~/.xmms/Plugins or to your XMMS plugin directory.

Notes
=====

AAC files are recognized by an .aac extension.

Will not recognize files with unicode characters in the filename.

Sometimes, seeking to the very last seconds of a file will cause a decode 
error: "Unable to find ADTS syncword".
